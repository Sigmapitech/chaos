%title: GLOBAL VARIABLES

%description: Global variables must be avoided as much as possible.
Only global constants should be used.

A constant is considered as such if and only if it is correctly marked 
with the const key-word. Watch out, this keyword follows some particular 
and sometimes surprising rules!

```c
const float GOLDEN_RATIO = 1.61803398875; /* OK */
int uptime = 0; /* C - G4 violation */
```
