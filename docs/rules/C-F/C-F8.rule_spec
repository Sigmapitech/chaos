%title: COMMENTS INSIDE A FUNCTION

%description: There must be no comment within a function.
The function should be readable and self-explanatory, without further need for
 explanations inside it.

The length of a function is inversely proportional to its complexity, so a 
complicated function should be short. In that case, a header comment should be
 enough to explain it.
