%title: COHERENCE OF FUNCTIONS
%description: A function should only do one thing, not mix different levels of
 abstraction, and respect the single-responsibility principle 
 (a function should be changed only for one reason).

For example, a call to malloc(), a call to allocate_user(), and a call to 
create_user() all have 3 different levels of abstraction.
