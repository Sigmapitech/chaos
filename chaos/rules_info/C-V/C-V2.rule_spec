@title: STRUCTURES

@description: Variables can be grouped together into a structure if and only if
 they form a coherent entity. Structures must be kept as small as possible.

```c
struct person {                  /* OK */
	char * name;
	unsigned int age;
	float salary;
};

struct data {                    /* C-V2 violation */
	struct person player;
	unsigned int width;
	unsigned int length;
	unsigned int score;
	int i;
};
```
