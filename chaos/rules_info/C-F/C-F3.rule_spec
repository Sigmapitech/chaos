@title: NUMBER OF COLUMNS

@description: The length of a line must not exceed 80 columns 
(not to be confused with 80 characters).

A tab represents 1 character, but several columns.
The line break character (\n) is part of the line, and thus counts in its
 length.

Even though this rule especially applies to functions, it applies to all C
 files, as well as Makefiles.
