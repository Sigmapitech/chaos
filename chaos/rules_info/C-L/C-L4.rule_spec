@title: CURLY BRACKETS

@description: Opening curly brackets must be at the end of the line, after the
 content it precedes, except for functions definitions where they must be
 placed alone on their line.

Closing curly brackets must be alone on their line, except in the case of
 else/else if control structures, enum declarations, or structure declarations
 (with or without an associated typedef).

```c
if (cond) {return ptr;}                           /* C-L1 & C-L4 violations */
while (cond) {                                    /* OK */
   do_something();
}
if (cond)
{                                                 /* C-L4 violation */
    ...
} else {                                          /* OK */
    ...
}
if (cond) {                                       /* OK */
    ...
}                                                 /* C-L4 violation */
else {
    ...
}
if (cond)                                         /* Tolerated */
    return ptr;
int print_env(void)                               /* OK */
{
    ...
}
int print_env(void) {                             /* C-L4 violation */
    ...
}
struct coords {                                   /* OK */
    int x;
    int y;
};
struct coords
{                                                 /* C-L4 violation */
    int x;
    int y;
};
```

Even though this primarily applies to the contents of functions, this rule also
 applies to code outside functions, including header filesâ€™.
